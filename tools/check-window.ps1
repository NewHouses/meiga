.SYNOPSIS
Checks that meiga.exe opens its window and closes it cleanly.

.DESCRIPTION
Starts meiga.exe and checks that:

- it is a GUI program (Windows subsystem), so it opens no console window;
- it shows a window of class "meiga" with the title "meiga";
- the window is DPI aware per monitor (v2), as the embedded manifest asks;
- it ends with exit code 0 when the window is closed, as when the user clicks
  the X button of the title bar.

If a check fails, the script ends meiga.exe, so that it never stays open.

.PARAMETER Path
The executable to check. Defaults to target\release\meiga.exe.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
How long to wait for the window, and then for the process to end.
